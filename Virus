A virus is a small parasite that cannot reproduce by itself. Once it infects a susceptible cell,
however, a virus can direct the cell machinery to produce more viruses. Most viruses have either RNA 
or DNA as their genetic material. The nucleic acid may be single- or double-stranded. 
The entire infectious virus particle, called a virion, consists of the nucleic acid and an outer shell of protein. The simplest viruses contain only enough RNA or
DNA to encode four proteins. The most complex can encode 100 – 200 proteins.
